# Computer Music-Reinforcement Learning
Abstract 

As the world undergoes a digital revolution, the musical arts are undergoing their own computer revolutions in making and sharing sound. Since the 90â€™s, computers have become increasingly involved in all aspects of musical production. At first, it was the digitization of sound itself, transitioning from analog to digital and vinyl to MP3. Nowadays, most of the revolutions in computerized music are coming from artificial intelligence and machine learning. More recent advances in the field have come from deep learning, specifically training RNN models end-to-end on large corpuses of musical data. In this research project, we examine the foundations of RNN models and apply domain knowledge of musical theory, through reinforcement learning, to improve upon state-of-the-art models, following code from Google Magenta. 

In this report, I begin with a theoretical background on the types of neural network architectures used in our study (some background in math is required). I go on to introduce the field of automatic composition for chord progressions and provide a review of previous uses of our architecture types applied historically to generate chords. We then look at the real work of the project: training a full LSTM model and tuning the output with reinforcement learning and musical theory.
