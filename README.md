# Computer Music-Reinforcement Learning
Abstract 
In this project, I investigated the research and efforts of Google’s Magenta team on the effectiveness of adding reinforcement learning (music-theory based penalties and rewards) to LSTM music generators. This project was done as part of Columbia University’s senior applied mathematics research seminar (APMA 4903).
