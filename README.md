# Computer Music-Reinforcement Learning
Abstract 

Reinforcement learning is a powerful technical concept that can be used to improve neural networks through defining reward and loss in an iterative learning cycle. In this project, I investigated the research and efforts of Google’s Magenta team on the effectiveness of adding reinforcement learning to state of the art LSTM music generators. This project was done as part of Columbia University’s senior applied mathematics research seminar (APMA 4903).
